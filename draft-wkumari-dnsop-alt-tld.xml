    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Lots of protocols and systems need to name entities, and the DNS
      "standard" of a series of labels separated with dots has become common,
      even in systems that are not actually part of the DNS, and involving
      lookups that do not actually </t>

      <t>This document reserves the string "ALT" (short for Alternate) as a
      Special Use Domain (<xref target="RFC6761"></xref>) that should be used
      in the right-most label position to signify that this name is not rooted
      in the DNS, and that normal registration and lookup rules do not apply.

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>[ WK: I'm really bad at terminology thingies. This section needs
        much more precision ] </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>DNS context: The namespace administered by ICANN. This is the
            namespace / context that "normal" DNS uses.</t>

            <t>non-DNS context: Any other / alternate namespace.</t>

            <t></t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>The DNS is a distributed hierarchical database, primarily used to map
      human memorable names to IP addresses. DNS names are composed of a set
      of LDH (Letter, Digit and Hyphen) labels, separated by dots. The DNS has
      a single root, and each delegation under this is a Top Level Domain
      (TLD). TLDs delegate portions of their namespace to nameserver, who may
      then delegate further. The hierarchical, distributed, caching nature of
      the DNS has made it the primary resolution system on the Internet. </t>

      <t>The success of the DNS means make sit a natural starting point for
      systems that need to name entities in a non-DNS context. These name
      resolutions occur in a namespace distinct from the DNS. A number of good
      examples of these sorts of systems are documented in Special-Use Domain
      Names of Peer-to-Peer Systems
      (draft-grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names) [TODO(WK): Make ref].</t>

      <t>In many cases these systems build a DNS style inverted tree parallel
      to the "standard" (IANA?) DNS tree, and use a pseudo-TLD to cause
      resolution in this alternate namespace, using things like browser
      plugins, shims in the name resolution process, or simply applications
      only use this alternate namespace.</t>

      <t>In many cases the creators of these alternate namespaces have simply
      chosen a convenient / descriptive string and started using this. Using
      names in an alternate namespace may cause issues if they are looked up
      in the DNS. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>User confusion: If someone emails a link of the form
          foo.bar.pseudo-TLD to someone who does not have the necessary
          software to resolve names in the pseudo-TLD namespace, they may
          become confused.</t>

          <t>Excess traffic hitting the DNS root. Lookups may leak out of the
          pseudo-TLD namespace and end up hitting the DNS root
          nameservers.</t>

          <t>Collisions. If the pseudo-TLD is eventually delegated by ICANN
          the behavior may be non-deterministic.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="The ALT namespace">
      <t>In order to avoid the above issues we reserve the .ALT label. This
      label should be used as a pseudo-TLD (in the right most (TLD) position
      of a name) to signify that this is an alternate (non-DNS) namespace.
      </t>

      <t>Alternate namespaces should differentiate themselves from other
      alternate namespaces by choosing a name and using it in the label
      position just before the pseudo-TLD. For example, a group wishing create
      a namespace for [TODO(?): Need something better] Friends Of Olaf they
      may choose the string "foo" and use any set of labels under foo.alt.</t>

      <t>As they are in an alternate namespace they have no significance in
      the regular DNS context and so should not be looked up in the DNS
      context. Unfortunately simply saying that "something should not happen"
      doesn't actually stop it from happening, so we need some rules to deal
      with these. </t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Stub resolvers SHOULD NOT send queries to recursive resolvers for
          names in the ALT TLD</t>

          <t>Recursive resolvers SHOULD return NXDOMAIN (authoritative (AA=1)
          name errors (RCODE=3)) for queries in the ALT TLD. [ED NOTE: The ALT
          "TLD" should be added to the RFC6303 "Locally Served Zones"
          registry.]</t>

          <t>The root zone nameservers should either return NXDOMAIN
          responses, or the ALT TLD should be delegated to "new style" AS112
          nameservers (TODO(WK): WK, JA, BD to revive AS112 / AS112-bis).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Groups wishing to create alternate namespaces SHOULD create their
      alternate namespace "under" a label that names their namespace, and
      "under" the ALT label. They SHOULD choose a label that they expect to be
      unique / descriptive. As there is no registry for the ALT namespace
      uniqueness is not guaranteed.</t>

      <t>Currently deployed projects and protocols that are using pseudo-TLDs
      (for example, the ".onion" pseudo-TLD (and other labels in
      draft-grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names ) are not expected to move
      under the ALT TLD (but may do so if they wish, this is a common
      resource). Rather, the ALT TLD is being reserved so that future projects
      of a similar nature have a designated place to create alternate
      resolution namespaces that will not conflict with the regular DNS
      context.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The IANA is requested to add the ALT string to the "Special-Use
      Domain Name" registry (<xref target="RFC6761"></xref>, and reference
      this document. In addition, the "Locally Served DNS Zones" (<xref
      target="RFC6303"></xref>) registry should be updated to refernce this
      document. </t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>The authors understand that there is much politics surrounding the
      delegation of a new TLD and thank the ICANN liaison (and any other poor
      bugger who gets sucked into this) in advance. </t>
