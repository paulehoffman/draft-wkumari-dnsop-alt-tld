      <t>This document reserves a string to be used as a TLD label in non-DNS

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Lots of protocols and systems need to name entities, and the DNS
      "standard" of a series of labels separated with dots has become common,
      even in systems that are not actually part of the DNS.</t>

      <t>This document reserves the string "ALT" (short for Alternate) as a
      Special Use Domain (<xref target="RFC6761"></xref>) that should be used
      in the right-most label position to signify that this name is not rooted
      in the DNS, and that normal registration and lookup rules do not
      apply.</t>

      <section title="Requirements notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document assumes familiarity with DNS terms and concepts.
        Please see <xref target="RFC1034"></xref> for background and
        concepts.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>DNS context: The namespace administered by ICANN. This is the
            namespace / context that "normal" DNS uses.</t>

            <t>non-DNS context: Any other / alternate namespace.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>The DNS is a tree, and so has a single root. Conventionally, a name
      immediately beneath the root is called a "Top Level Domain" or "TLD".
      TLDs usually delegate portions of their namespace to others, who may
      then delegate further. The hierarchical, distributed, caching nature of
      the DNS has made it the primary resolution system on the Internet.</t>

      <t>The success of the DNS means makes it a natural starting point for
      systems that need to name entities in a non-DNS context. These name
      resolutions occur in a namespace distinct from the DNS. A number of good
      examples of these sorts of systems are documented in Special-Use Domain
      Names of Peer-to-Peer Systems <xref
      target="I-D.grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names"></xref> </t>

      <t>In many cases, these systems build a DNS style tree parallel to the
      global DNS administered by IANA. They often use a pseudo-TLD to cause
      resolution in this alternate namespace, using things like browser
      plugins, shims in the name resolution process, or simply applications
      only use this alternate namespace.</t>

      <t>In many cases the creators of these alternate namespaces have simply
      chosen a convenient / descriptive string and started using this. These
      new strings are "alternate" strings, and not actually registered
      anywhere or part of the DNS. However they appear to be TLDs, as they are
      the in the right-most position of a name. Issues may arise if they are
      looked up in the DNS. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>User confusion: If someone emails a link of the form
          foo.bar.pseudo-TLD to someone who does not have the necessary
          software to resolve names in the pseudo-TLD namespace, they may
          become confused.</t>

          <t>Excess traffic hitting the DNS root. Lookups may leak out of the
          pseudo-TLD namespace and end up hitting the DNS root
          nameservers.</t>

          <t>Collisions. If the pseudo-TLD is eventually delegated from the
          root zone the behavior may be non-deterministic.</t>

          <t>Lack of success for the user's original goal.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="The ALT namespace">
      <t>In order to avoid the above issues we reserve the .ALT label. This
      label should be used as a pseudo-TLD (in the right most (TLD) position
      of a name) to signify that this is an alternate (non-DNS) namespace.</t>

      <t>Alternate namespaces should differentiate themselves from other
      alternate namespaces by choosing a name and using it in the label
      position just before the pseudo-TLD. For example, a group wishing create
      a namespace for Friends Of Olaf they may choose the string "foo" and use
      any set of labels under foo.alt.</t>

      <t>As they are in an alternate namespace they have no significance in
      the regular DNS context and so should not be looked up in the DNS
      context. Unfortunately simply saying that "something should not happen"
      doesn't actually stop it from happening, so we need some rules to deal
      with these.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Stub resolvers MAY elect not to send queries to any upstream
          resolver for names in the ALT TLD.</t>

          <t>Iterative resolvers SHOULD follow the advice in <xref
          target="RFC6303"></xref>, Section 3.</t>

          <t>The root zone nameservers should either return NXDOMAIN
          responses, or the ALT TLD should be delegated to "new style" AS112
          nameservers. (TODO(WK): WK, JA, BD to revive AS112 / AS112-bis).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Groups wishing to create alternate namespaces SHOULD create their
      alternate namespace "under" a label that names their namespace, and
      "under" the ALT label. They SHOULD choose a label that they expect to be
      unique / descriptive. As there is no registry for the ALT namespace
      uniqueness is not guaranteed.</t>

      <t>Currently deployed projects and protocols that are using pseudo-TLDs
      (for example, the ".onion" pseudo-TLD (and other labels in <xref
      target="I-D.grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names"></xref>) are not
      expected to move under the ALT TLD (but may do so if they wish; this is
      a common resource). Rather, the ALT TLD is being reserved so that future
      projects of a similar nature have a designated place to create alternate
      resolution namespaces that will not conflict with the regular DNS
      context.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The IANA is requested to add the ALT string to the "Special-Use
      Domain Name" registry (<xref target="RFC6761"></xref>, and reference
      this document. In addition, the "Locally Served DNS Zones" (<xref
      target="RFC6303"></xref>) registry should be updated to reference this
      document.</t>

      <t>[ Ed: There are two options here. Option 1: We could ask the IANA to
      run a "First Come First Served" registry for labels under the ALT TLD.
      By registry I mean a "standard" IANA registry, not a registry in the DNS
      sense of the word (IANA would publish on a webpage "Foo |
      fred@example.com | Used for the foo project"). Option 2: This is a fully
      uncoordinated space (in the same way that people have been picking
      pseudo-TLDs up till now) -- pick something that, as far as you know
      other's are not using... There are pros and cons to both -- I don't want
      to overload the IANA, have people stage a land-grab for names, or give
      the impression that this is a "real" TLD. Thoughts? Currently we say
      there is no registry (Section 3), but that can be changed.)]</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>One of the motivators for the creation of the alt pseudo-TLD is that
      unmanaged labels in the managed root name space are subject to
      unexpected takeover if the manager of the root name space decides to
      delegate the unmanaged label.</t>

      <t>The unmanaged and registry-free nature of labels beneath .ALT
      provides the opportunity for an attacker to re-use the chosen label and
      thereby possibly compromise applications dependent on the special host
      name.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>The authors understand that there is much politics surrounding the
      delegation of a new TLD and thank the ICANN liaison (and any other poor
      sod who gets sucked into this) in advance.</t>
